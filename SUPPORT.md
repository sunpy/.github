# Getting Help

## Documentation

We strive to provide a rich and comprehensive set of documentation for all packages under the SunPy project.
For sunpy core, the [sunpy documentation] includes [examples] and an API layout that you can access through the [code reference].
All packages under the SunPy project have their own documentation, that can be found by clicking on the "Documentation" dropdown above.

## Asking questions

The recommended way to ask questions or get help with any of the packages under the SunPy project is the [OpenAstronomy discourse].
Any questions you can be asked in the "Ask Questions" category.

If you have a quick or shorter question, we also have a [element.io channel] for chatting, and you will find many sunpy users and developers within the channel.
Please do stop by and say hello!
You can login with any element.io account by typing in your full username, e.g., `@cadair:matrix.org`.
