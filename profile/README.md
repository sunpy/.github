**sunpy** is a community-developed free and open-source software package for solar physics.
It aims to be a comprehensive data analysis environment that allows researchers within the field of solar physics to carry out their tasks with the minimal effort.

In addition, _The SunPy Project_ was established in order to further the goals of the **sunpy** package.
_The SunPy Project_ wants to provide the software tools necessary so that anyone can analyze the ever increasing catalogue of solar data.
This enables the targeted support of other solar physics Python packages that do not fall within the scope of the core **sunpy** package.
