## Provide Feedback

We could always use more voices and opinions in the discussions about sunpy and its development from both users and developers.
You may want to suggest a new feature or tell us about how something is not working in the manner you would expect it to.
There are a number of ways to make your voice heard and we would love to hear from you.

We strongly recommend that your first port of call would be to our lovely [matrix channel].
Here you can get in easily get in touch with developers or users for questions or support.
This is the most lively part of the community!

If you prefer email:

- [The general mailing list] is a great place to start.
  Here we answer questions about sunpy or send out major announcements.
- If you have technical issue about the code or want advice on how to help sunpy, the [developer mailing list] is another good place.
  This is where you can find the nitty gritty nuts and bolts discussions about the SunPy codebase.

Please note that these do not get a lot of traffic, so the matrix channel or [GitHub] might be better places to start.

## Report Bugs

If you run into unexpected behavior or run into a bug we urge you to please report it.
All bugs are kept track of on our [issue tracker].
You can add a bug report there or you can report it on [matrix channel] or an email to the [developer mailing list].
Ideally, we would like a short code example so we can reproduce the bug on our own machines.
